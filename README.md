    <h2>Andrew Jones: Software Tester</h2>
    <h6>April 24 2018</h6>
<li>I run a team of about 20 software testers.
A long time ago all testing was done manually. Some still is today.
But now we automate some testing using programming languages like Java.
An example is when you open up Microsoft Word and click new document someone would manually try to make sure it works. 
Now we write code that simulates that. 
It saves man hours by not doing that stuff manually. Instead these tests are automated 
Instead once tests are coded we just click start and the code we wrote does it automatically and let's us know if the test 
passed or failed. In the future when new functionality is added to software we try to automate this testing so we don't have 
to manually test all the time.

<li> I first started to study computer science and computer engineering in 1980 at the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava. 
 After finishing I stayed to complete my masters, after completing I stayed as a professor until the 90s, during which I completed my 
 PHD. Since the future of Europe was unclear I took my family and immigrated to Canada in 2000. There I quit the teaching life and 
 started working industry.. With the change of scenery I always had to research new languages and spent most of my free time learning 
 and improving.I currently work as a computer programmer at benbria, it is my livelihood I have worked there for a couple of years now. 
 I now also have started my own side project with a few former colleagues and that takes most of my time.”
Hoping that the company keeps going at the pace it is, or hopefully faster, I would start working it full time move into an office get
 employees and turn into a full business.

<li>I started at Carleton in 2005 towards a bachelor of computer science, I did the Co op program for 5 semesters alternating 
 work and class, I recommend this because it gives a lot of hands on experience and also connection with other professionals. 
 I worked at Ubiquity software for 2 years during coop which was bought by a larger company(avia). During that time I was at many 
 small companies that got bought out. I decided to leave my honours project for later so I graduated in 2012 and started working full 
 time at head wall software and did my honours on the side. After taking a quick break from work I’ve now started working at Dialogic 
 and plan on working there for a bit. However I plan on switching jobs around every 2 years and slowly gaining experiences and titles.
I mentioned that i was a part of a couple companies that were bought out, I wouldn’t mind, with help, starting a company and maybe 
merging with a bigger one, however still relatively new to the profession I still wish to learn more until I try being more independent.
